# Robust-RL-with-KL-divergence
This is the repo for presenting the experimental results of our paper: Distributionally Robust  Model-Based Offline Reinforcement Learning with Near-Optimal Sample Complexity

More details will be specified later.
The code is implemented based on https://github.com/kishanpb/RobustRL
